# Mondrian-Painting-Project
This is a random painting from Mondrian. Not so difficult but pretty tricky :Dthe

Hint:
The height of box which has border should include the width of border
For example: 
grid-template-rows: 320px 360px 130px 130px; (with 320px = 300px (height of box) + 20px (width of border); 
                                                   130px = 120px (height of box)  + 10px(width of border) )
